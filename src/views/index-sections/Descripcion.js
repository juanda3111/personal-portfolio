        <p>I am Juan David and I am a graduate software engineer with more than 2 years of experience coding. </p>
        <p>I specialized in the MERN stack, although I have a lot of previous experience with php (building things for Wordpress and using php frameworks such as codeigniter or laravel), and some understanding in Java.</p>
        <p>At the time I'm looking a position where I can use some JS (honestly, I'm quite good with php but I personally prefer JS .... both are good and useful langages but is just a matter of personal preference).</p>
        <p>I had use some angular and Vue for front-end projects in the past, but I prefer react (I feel the way react deals with the components and the functions is more intuitive for daily coding). I used React for this portfolio page by the way. <i class="fas fa-smile-wink"></i> </p>
        <p> If you are interested in talking, just write to me and I would respond as soon as I can.</p>
